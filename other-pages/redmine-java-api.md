We originally created Redmine Java library to use in Task Adapter application. We open-sourced it in 2011 and moved to Github in 2012.
We hope you find this library useful. Your code patches and other contributions are always welcome!
The current project location is <a href="https://github.com/taskadapter/redmine-java-api">https://github.com/taskadapter/redmine-java-api</a>.
