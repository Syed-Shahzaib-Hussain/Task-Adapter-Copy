<p>5. One User is a person or a software/script/program accessing or using the Software in any way.</p>
<p>6. The Software may report anonymous usage statistics to the Licensor. Your personal data will NEVER be transferred. We only collect information like: geographical location where the Software is used, most used features, Internet browser type used to access the Software, etc. This is NOT Personally Identifiable Information. This is generally the same information collected by most websites in the world through Google Analytics service to understand users demographics and behavior. Please contact us to modify the Software if your company policy forbids transfer of this kind of information.  </p>
<p>7. NO REDISTRIBUTION of this software is allowed without explicit permission from Licensor.</p>
<p>8. This Software is subject to a limited warranty. Licensor warrants to Licensee<br />
that the physical medium on which this Software is distributed is free from defects<br />
in materials and workmanship under normal use, the Software will perform according to<br />
its printed documentation, and to the best of Licensor's knowledge Licensee's use<br />
of this Software according to the printed documentation is not an infringement of<br />
any third party's intellectual property rights. This limited warranty lasts for a period<br />
of 365 days after delivery.<br />
To the extent permitted by law, THE ABOVE-STATED LIMITED WARRANTY REPLACES ALL OTHER WARRANTIES,<br />
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND LICENSOR DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF TITLE,<br />

No agent of Licensor is authorized to make any other warranties or to modify this limited warranty.<br />
Any action for breach of this limited warranty must be commenced within one year of the expiration<br />
of the warranty. Because some jurisdictions do not allow any limit on the length of an implied warranty,<br />
the above limitation may not apply to this Licensee.<br />
If the law does not allow disclaimer of implied warranties,<br />
then any implied warranty is limited to 365 days after delivery of the Software to Licensee.<br />
Licensee has specific legal rights pursuant to this warranty and, depending on Licensee's jurisdiction,<br />
may have additional rights.</p>

INCLUDING COMPENSATORY, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES,<br />
CONNECTED WITH OR RESULTING FROM THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT OR LICENSEE'S USE OF THIS SOFTWARE.<br />
Licensee's jurisdiction may not allow such a limitation of damages, so this limitation may not apply.</p>

losses, damages, complaints, or expenses connected with or resulting from Licensee's business operations.</p>
<p>11. Licensor has the right to terminate this License Agreement and Licensee's right to use this Software<br />
