We offer **access to the Task Adapter source code**.

* This is a non-exclusive access which allows you to make any modifications to the source code and build Task Adapter product **for your own needs;** **redistribution is NOT permitted**.
* This includes some reasonable support time to help you with the dev environment, answer your questions about the source code, build process, etc.
* You can get access to the main repository (and thus get all the future updates) or get your own copy.
* This allows you to use Task Adapter **on any number of computers (no licensing per user)**.
* The access is granted for 1 year from the date of the purchase.

**Technical details:**

* Java language is used for both server and client side.
* Git is used as a source control system.
* There's a set of unit and integration tests.
* There's documentation on the dev process and environment setup.
* "Core" module is separate from the UI so you can remove the UI layer from the build and implement any UI you want.
* Every data connector (Redmine, JIRA, etc) is separate so you can easily remove them from the build to build a custom version for your needs.
