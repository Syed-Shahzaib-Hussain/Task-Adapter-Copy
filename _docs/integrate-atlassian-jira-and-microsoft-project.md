<p>**Sample usage scenarios for Task Adapter:**</p>
<p>**1. From Microsoft Project to Atlassian JIRA.**</p>
<div>
<p>****You created a project plan in Microsoft Project and you need to submit all those tasks with time estimates, dates, relations into your bug tracking system.</p>
<div>
<p>Then update the project file in MSP (change estimates, add tasks or edit tasks' summaries, etc) and send the updates into the bug tracker.</p>

<p>**2. From JIRA to Microsoft Project and back.**</p>
<p>JIRA does not give a good view of how much work is left on the project.

There are some Gantt diagrams, but they are pretty basic and non interactive.</p>
<div>You can export live project data from Atlassian JIRA into a Microsoft Project file, use Microsoft Project

or compatible software to edit the tasks and then send the updates back to JIRA.</div>

</div>
