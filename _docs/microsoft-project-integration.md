<p>Microsoft Project (MSP) is a powerful project planning tool.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the project plan created by it is almost impossible to keep up-to-date. Many managers use Microsoft Project in the beginning of a project to roughly estimate required resources and completion date, but when the project actually starts, the plan quickly becomes out of date and useless.</p>
<p>What if you could always have up-to-date information about your project in Microsoft Project format?</p>
<p>Use Task Adapter to load the current "Snapshot" of your project  from your bug tracking  / task management system like Atlassian JIRA, Github website, MantisBT Redmine, etc - and save into a Microsoft Project file.</p>
<p>You can even update the created file using Microsoft Project and re-export data back to your bug tracker. New tasks will be created and the old ones will be updated.</p>
