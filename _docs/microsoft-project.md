## Microsoft Project

Microsoft Project (MSP) is a powerful project planning tool.

Unfortunately, the project plan created by it is almost impossible to keep up-to-date. Many managers use Microsoft Project in the beginning of a project to roughly estimate required resources and completion date, but when the project actually starts, the plan quickly becomes out of date and useless.
What if you could always have up-to-date information about your project in Microsoft Project format?
Use Task Adapter to load the current "Snapshot" of your project  from your bug tracking  / task management system like Atlassian JIRA, Github website, MantisBT Redmine, etc - and save into a Microsoft Project file.
You can even update the created file using Microsoft Project and re-export data back to your bug tracker. New tasks will be created and the old ones will be updated.
