## Sample usage scenarios for Task Adapter

### From Microsoft Project to Atlassian JIRA.

You created a project plan in Microsoft Project and you need to submit all those tasks with time estimates,
dates, relations into your bug tracking system.

Then update the project file in MSP (change estimates, add tasks or edit tasks' summaries, etc)
and send the updates into the bug tracker.

### From JIRA to Microsoft Project and back.

JIRA does not give a good view of how much work is left on the project.

There are some Gantt diagrams, but they are pretty basic and non interactive.

You can export live project data from Atlassian JIRA into a Microsoft Project file, use Microsoft Project
or compatible software to edit the tasks and then send the updates back to JIRA.
