<p>Now when 1.6.0 release is out, it's time to spend some time cleaning up our development infrastructure.<br/>Step 1 was to migrate the source code from Subversion to GIT. This process took several hours and now all history, code branches, tags - everything is in GIT.<br/>There was a problem with GIT plugin on our build server (Jenkins CI), which I reported to the developers and hopefully it will be resolved soon.<br/><br/></p>
