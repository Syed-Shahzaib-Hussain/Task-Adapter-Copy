<p>We're working on the web-based version of Task Adapter. It will have several benefits comparing to the old Eclipse-based application:<br/><br/>
<ul>
<li>can run on server and be used by several users</li>
<li>can run "data synchronization" tasks in scheduled mode</li></ul><br/>The new version still has a long way to go before it is ready for public review. The current development "snapshot" is almost&nbsp;functional, but ugly and buggy and does not support scheduled tasks transfer.<br/>Here's how the current UI looks like:<br/>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Wb_lmpBN0-0/Txp2vSWR0iI/AAAAAAAAHoY/zMtnlKSMJss/s1600/ta_web.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="190" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Wb_lmpBN0-0/Txp2vSWR0iI/AAAAAAAAHoY/zMtnlKSMJss/s320/ta_web.PNG" width="320" /></a></div>Feel free to subscribe to the blog news to get updates on the development progress.</p>
