<p>We're working on the web-based version of Task Adapter. It will have several benefits comparing to the old Eclipse-based application:<br/><br/>
<ul>
* can run on server and be used by several users
* can run "data synchronization" tasks in scheduled mode</ul><br/>The new version still has a long way to go before it is ready for public review. The current development "snapshot" is almost functional, but ugly and buggy and does not support scheduled tasks transfer.<br/>Here's how the current UI looks like:<br/>
