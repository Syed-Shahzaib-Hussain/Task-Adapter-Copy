<p>As we recently reported, the previous Task Adapter versions had troubles reading some data from XML files created by Microsoft Project 2013.</p>
<p>The new Task Adapter 2.6.3 released today brings full support for Microsoft Project 2013 format.</p>
<p>There are no other changes in this version.</p>
