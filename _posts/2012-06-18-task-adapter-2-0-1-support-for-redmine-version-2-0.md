<p>We are happy to announce the release of Task Adapter 2.0.1, which has full support for Redmine 2.0+. We have tested it with Redmine 1.4.2 and 2.0.2. We released a new Redmine Java API (1.12.0) in order to properly support both the old and new versions of Redmine (1.4x and 2.x).

This release did not change anything else in Task Adapter 2.0.1. So, if you are using Task Adapter with any other systems than Redmine, you should skip this release and wait for version 2.1 (coming soon).</p>
