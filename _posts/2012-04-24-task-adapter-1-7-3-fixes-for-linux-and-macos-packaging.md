<p>Today we got a user report about files not being marked as "executable" in MacOS version. Apparently, Linux version had the same problem. We fixed this problem right away and released v. 1.7.3.<br/>This version does not have any other user-facing changes, so Windows users should simply ignore this release.</p>
