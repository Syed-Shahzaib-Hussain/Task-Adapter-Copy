<p>Some of you already know you can see Task Adapter's development plans here: <a href="https://www.hostedredmine.com/projects/ta">https://www.hostedredmine.com/projects/ta</a><br/>For example, you can see the <a href="https://www.hostedredmine.com/projects/ta/versions/1614">release plan for Task Adapter 1.6.0</a><br/><br/>We decided not to host our own bug tracker for now, so you need to register directly at www.hostedredmine.com if you want to submit a new feature or a bug request.</p>
