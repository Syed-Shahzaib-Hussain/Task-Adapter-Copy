Task Adapter 2.7 brings support for drag-n-drop operations for Microsoft Project files.

Now instead of providing path to your MPP or XML files in "Microsoft Project Editor",
you can simply drag-n-drop your file to the export button,
the file will be loaded right away and the export will start  automatically.
