<p>Redmine 1.3.0 was recently released with several Remote API improvements. The most important one is<span style="font-family: inherit;"> "<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.redmine.org&#47;issues&#47;7366" style="background-color: white; text-align: left; text-decoration: none;"><span style="color: black;">REST API for Issue Relations</span></a>", which is required for</span>&nbsp;Task Adapter to&nbsp;save "precedes-follows" task relations. This means that "task 1 must be completed before task 2 is started" information won't be lost when exporting from Microsoft Project to Redmine anymore.<br/><br/>The current Task Adapter version already supports this Redmine feature.<br/><br/>Congratulations to Redmine development team!<br/><br/><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.redmine.org&#47;news&#47;59">Redmine 1.3.0 Release Announcement</a></p>
