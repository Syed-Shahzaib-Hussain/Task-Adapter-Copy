<p>Task Adapter 2.4 was released today.</p>
<p>It features support for Basecamp project management system and a lot of bugfixes, primarily in the User Interface (specifically - in Redmine and Mantis Bug Tracker editors).<br />
Another important change is the default HTTP port number being 9944 instead of 8080 to reduce the number of potential port conflicts.<br />
Please, try the <a href="http://www.taskadapter.com/download">latest Task Adapter release</a> and let us know what you think.</p>
