<p>Task Adapter 2.4 was released today.</p>
<p>It features support for Basecamp project management system and a lot of bugfixes, primarily in the User Interface (specifically - in Redmine and Mantis Bug Tracker editors).

Another important change is the default HTTP port number being 9944 instead of 8080 to reduce the number of potential port conflicts.
