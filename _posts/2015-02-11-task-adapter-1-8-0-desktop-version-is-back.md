<p>We decided to perform an experiment and bring the original desktop version of TaskAdapter back to live. It has been retrofitted to work with modern bug trackers, just like the current TaskAdapter Web-version. It is released as "TaskAdapter - desktop version v. 1.8.0".</p>
<p>Feel free to give it a try and let us know if you prefer the web-based or desktop-based one.</p>
